Data Understanding
Identify variable types
Convert rubbish values in 'Material_Reference' to null
Treat reference columns as categorical variables
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest
For simplicity, let's use IQR
Identify and treat skewness using log transformation
Visualizing outliers and skewness
